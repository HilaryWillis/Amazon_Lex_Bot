# Amazon_Lex_Bot

## Background
You’ve been hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country. They want to increase their client portfolio—especially by engaging young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, you decide to create a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

## What You're Creating
In this Challenge, you’ll combine your new AWS skills with your existing Python superpowers to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

You’ll be asked to accomplish the following main tasks:

1. Configure the initial robo advisor: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

2. Build and test the robo advisor: Make sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.

3. Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.

For the submission, you will upload the following files to your repo:

1. A Python script with your final Lambda function.

2. Two short videos or animated GIFs that demo your robo advisor in action from the “Test bot” pane as requested.

## Step One:
In this section, you create the robo advisor bot and add an intent with its corresponding slots. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to your AWS Management Console, and then create a new custom Amazon Lex bot (Links to an external site.). Use the following criteria:

Bot name: RoboAdvisor
Language: English (US)
Output voice: Salli
Session timeout: 5 minutes
Sentiment analysis: No
COPPA: No
Advanced options: No
All other options: The default value

2. Add a new intent, and name it recommendPortfolio.

3. Configure sample utterances as follows (you can add more utterances if you want):

I want to save money for my retirement
I'm {age} and I would like to invest for my retirement
I'm ​{age} and I want to invest for my retirement
I want the best option to invest for my retirement
I'm worried about my retirement
I want to invest for my retirement
I would like to invest for my retirement

4. Move to the “Confirmation prompt” section, and then set the following messages:

5. Confirm: Thanks, now I will look for the best investment portfolio for you.

6. Cancel: I will be pleased to assist you in the future.

## Step Two:
In this section, you build and test your robo advisor. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. To build your bot, click the Build button (in the upper-right corner of the page).

2. When the build finishes, test it in the “Test bot” pane.

3. Record a video or create an animated GIF of the working bot.

## Step Three:
In this section, you create an Amazon Lambda function to validate the data that a user supplies during a conversation with the robo advisor. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Create a new Lambda function from scratch, and name it recommendPortfolio. Choose Python 3.7 as the runtime programming language.

2. In the online code editor, delete the AWS-generated default lines of code, and then paste in the provided starter code from lambda_function.py.

3. Complete the recommend_portfolio function by adding the following validation rules:

The value of age should be greater than zero and less than 65.
The value of investment_amount should be greater than or equal to 5000.

4. Complete the starter code so that once the intent is fulfilled, the bot responds with an investment recommendation based on the selected risk level, as follows:

None: “100% bonds (AGG), 0% equities (SPY)”
Low: “60% bonds (AGG), 40% equities (SPY)”
Medium: “40% bonds (AGG), 60% equities (SPY)”
High: “20% bonds (AGG), 80% equities (SPY)”

5. When you finish coding your Lambda function, test it by using the provided test events.

6. After successfully testing your code, open the Amazon Lex console, and then navigate to the recommendPortfolio bot configuration. Integrate your new Lambda function into the bot by selecting it in the “Lambda initialization and validation” and “Fulfillment” sections.

7. Build your bot, and then test it with both valid and invalid data for the slots.

8. Record a video or create an animated GIF of the working bot.
